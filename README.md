# Horizen View
## Overview
The project was designed to display a simple-to-read interface that lets the user click through the astrological times of day. Specifically, the time of sunrise, sunset, noon, and when civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight begin and end. These times are for the specific location provided by the user in coordinates, as well as on the opposite side of the world from the input coordinates.
